# Product Review Sentiment Analyzer based on Amazon

#### Project Topics

This project, a Product Review Sentiment Analyzer, combines product ratings to re-rate products by analyzing the emotional expressions in the review text.

At the same time, we also reduce the influence of fake reviews to a greater extent, and give a more real and fair product rating.

In addition, we will also give a summary of the key words of the negative review obtained from the analysis, because when comparing similar products, users will pay more attention to the poor performance of the product than the advantages of the product.

In general, our goal is to give people a more intuitive and relatively fair rating and overall review without spending too much time browsing and identifying a large number of reviews.
